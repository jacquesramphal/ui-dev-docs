  <summary><strong>How to undo your last commit and re-push</strong></summary>
  
1. Go to your branch

`git checkout your-branch-name`

2. Revert the commit this goes back to before your commit

`git reset HEAD~1`

#### Note

    Use ~ most of the time ‚Äî to go back a number of generations, usually what you want
    Use ^ on merge commits ‚Äî because they have two or more (immediate) parents

    Tilde ~ is almost linear in appearance and wants to go backward in a straight line
    Caret ^ suggests an interesting segment of a tree or a fork in the road


3. Check changed/staged files (not yet committed)

`git status`

3b. you can either just commit the X number of files you want or undo the specifc file with

`git checkout fileName.js`

4. Once changes have been made/reverted, commit everything again

`git add *`

`git commit -m "XXX: Your New Commit Message"`

5. Force push updates since you‚Äôre erasing commits from before

`git push -f`

6. Check `git log` or review commits on Github to confirm update

  <summary><strong>Renaming a local and remote branch</strong></summary>

Follow the steps below to rename a Local and Remote Git Branch:

    Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename:

    git checkout <old_name>

    Rename the local branch by typing:

    git branch -m <new_name>

    At this point, you have renamed the local branch.

    If you‚Äôve already pushed the <old_name> branch to the remote repository , perform the next steps to rename the remote branch.

    Push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch:

    git push origin -u <new_name>

    Delete the <old_name> remote branch:

    git push origin --delete <old_name>

That‚Äôs it. You have successfully renamed the local and remote Git branch.

 <summary><strong>Multiple external commits displayed on PR.</strong></summary>
 
If you've pushed to master and are seeing commit history on the comparison page, you need to reset and cherry-pick the commit you want to push.

### Reset to Upstream Development
`git reset --hard origin/development`

> Running this command will revert all the work on the current branch. Make sure to back up your changes beforehand.

### Cherry-pick desired commit (you must cherry-pick each commit separately when using terminal)
`git cherry-pick (commit id from github)`

### Force push to GitHub
`git push -f`

Refresh the draft PR page -- now only one commit should show on the browser compare ui
