  <summary><strong>Renaming a local and remote branch</strong></summary>

Follow the steps below to rename a Local and Remote Git Branch:

    Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename:

    git checkout <old_name>

    Rename the local branch by typing:

    git branch -m <new_name>

    At this point, you have renamed the local branch.

    If you‚Äôve already pushed the <old_name> branch to the remote repository , perform the next steps to rename the remote branch.

    Push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch:

    git push origin -u <new_name>

    Delete the <old_name> remote branch:

    git push origin --delete <old_name>

That‚Äôs it. You have successfully renamed the local and remote Git branch.

If you've pushed to master and are seeing commit history on the comparison page, you need to reset and cherry-pick the commit you want to push.

### Reset to Upstream Development
`git reset --hard upstream/development`

> Running this command will revert all the work on the current branch. Make sure to back up your changes beforehand.

### Cherry-pick desired commit
`git cherry-pick (commit id from github)`

### Force push to GitHub
`git push -f`

Refresh the draft PR page -- now only one commit should show on the browser compare ui
