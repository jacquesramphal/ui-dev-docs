## Introduction to React

1. [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) / [45min Introductory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SsKMhGRuQw)

2. [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

   Stands for JavaScript XML and allows us to write HTML in React.

3. [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

   **Components**: Serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.
   
   **Props**: aka Propoerties are arguments passed into React components (like arguments in JS or attributes in HTML)
4. [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

   **State**: The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
  
   **Lifecycle**: Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: _Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting_.
 5. [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
