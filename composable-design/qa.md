## **xQC** WIP(project specific example below)

~~I’m still sorting this out with the team. There are two approaches that we discussed previously:~~

1. ~~Approach #1: Set up git repo to access the demo site. More work for us but I believe this is faster for the developers to push updates. Pro: Can QC early on. Con: You’ll likely be xQCing items on a component level.~~
2. ~~Approach #2: Demo site is uploaded to Netlify/Vercel. Pro: Easier for us to access and we see how components work together on a page. Con: Their changes take longer to upload. You might also have to QC different branches. One of our team members spearheaded amalgamating all branches for review every so often~~

~~Initially we agreed as a team that xQCing all components at a page level would be the approach(#2) we take. It seems there are some dependencies that are blocking us from doing so with this project.~~

## **Update as of Aug 6:**

We have access to an unconnected dev environment for xQC: [https://develop--pensive-pike-6b6146.netlify.app/](https://develop--pensive-pike-6b6146.netlify.app/) Password: WineTime!

These are the page paths available (add text after ellipses to the dev link):

- Subscription configuration page .../subscription
- Checkout .../checkout
- Consultant Dashboard .../consultant_dashboard
- Consultant Subscription .../consultant_subscription
- Account drawer (unauthenticated)
- Shopping Cart (empty)

## **Process and Format:**

Design will review shared preview links and provide xQC notes on Invision and/or Google sheets. @Vajeeh Paracha or @Evan Smith to prioritize the implementation of these changes.

Will set up ad-hoc xQC PowerHour sessions with Caroline or Hossein to go through and hammer out these changes.
