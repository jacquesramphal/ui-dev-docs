## **Slack Channels**

Some channels have been set up to streamline getting 
alignment/information out to the broader group. Recently we started one 
for Composable designers as the team is getting bigger. If I have 
questions relating to core Composable, I have an ad-hoc chat setup with 
Brooke and Yvonne.

## **Internal Reviews**

- **UX Review:** Currently designers can bring any items that require review to the design roundtable session that is held weekly.
- **Tech Vets:** I currently run at least 1 tech vet session per sprint before client
reviews. Weiling, Evan, and Vajeeh should be in those meetings. Feel
free to include the rest of the team as optional to provide context.

## **Scrum Team Ceremonies**

Daily standups for the team; Sprint planning and retro 
cadence are dependent on the sprint timebox. You may present during demo
 or you may present in a separate design focused demo.

The Product Development team invites us to their weekly 
sprint review to show things they’ve been working on since the prior 
sprint review.

## **Areas of Differentiation Presentation**

This presentation is meant to frame which areas would be of
 highest value to focus on and tailor Composable if needed using a 
variety of sources. This is an opportunity to get alignment with the 
stakeholders on their priorities but also remind them that anything 
outside of the prioritized options will be out-of-the-box. Template [here](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0IRcH1gGQ62u9y9WeBbGtirbA#Analyze_Review_Template_PL_0.1).

## **Design Studio (External)**

After getting alignment on the prioritized opportunities, 
you can set up a design studio session with the necessary stakeholders 
and focus on 1-2 topics to start. I’ve used Miro to collaborate with 
folks and on each board, I’ve included a rough agenda, house rules, and 
screenshots of the experience criteria + areas of opportunity for 
reference. You can find an example [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l35--yA=/).

## **Reusability Workshop**

Lisa put together a barebones Reusability [Workshop deck](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0ecqnucOrdgc5QtIgAvVlqF9A#PHK_Reusability_Workshop)
 + Miro board that she found would’ve been beneficial to do for Headless
 CMS projects. I haven’t had time to do it myself but maybe you still in
 future projects!

I’ll just copy and paste her note here:

*“This is an optional activity but post-Coravin
 think this type of activity would have been a game changer for us, 
especially in terms of reducing technical debt on developing content 
types/changing content model mid project.*

*I put this in Define 
as a placeholder, but I truly do not think you will have time to do this
 in Define and it might need to be done in Deploy OR you won’t be able 
to do it at all. And you’ll just have to use the reusability tracker to 
get a good sense of what all the content types and components are to 
well define a good headless content model.”*

## **Design/Dev Handoff**

Before designing hi-fi screens, I set up + upload sheets to
 Invision capturing the foundational styles and base component UI that 
will likely be used. Developers will set these up early on in the 
project. They look something like this:

- **Scout & Cellar Style Guide:** [https://myplanet.invisionapp.com/share/8P11HR4PVAQK%20](https://myplanet.invisionapp.com/share/8P11HR4PVAQK%20) (password:WineTime!)
- **Scout & Cellar Navigation Components + States:**
    - desktop: [https://myplanet.invisionapp.com/share/8X11HR6KTEUH](https://myplanet.invisionapp.com/share/8X11HR6KTEUH)
    - mobile: [https://myplanet.invisionapp.com/share/8D11HR79FXZB](https://myplanet.invisionapp.com/share/8D11HR79FXZB)

Interaction notes should be captured in the JIRA ticket + app map. Clean layers/groupings, export assets, etc. all still apply.

JIRA tickets won’t always be populated with 
requirements/details. To help out the devs, you may have follow-up with 
the Delivery/Solutions manager to have that information populated.

## **Working with External Designers**

Oftentimes, the client will have a designer that may be 
involved in the project. It’s important to establish roles and 
responsibilities for each person (e.g., you will be designing, they will
 be the key decision maker). It’s likely some education will need to be 
done wrt Composable’s capabilities, benefits, etc. and outline what 
customization needs to be done versus what can be used straight out of 
the theming UI box.

## **Escalation**

Roundtable ->  SM (Q requirements) -> design best 
practices (Yvonne/Brooke/Yao) -> Phoebe if it’s not resolved 
(operational)
