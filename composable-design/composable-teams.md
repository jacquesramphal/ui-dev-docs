Here are some of the teams that you may/may not be involved with.

## Product Development Team

Product Development focuses more on building for what the 
market needs. They are currently working on a Deploy project (Teilor) to
 understand Composable is being used by other teams. There haven’t been 
new design patterns developed for the core Composable product but they 
will return to building the product in a couple weeks.

## Deploy-Product Design Team (official name TBD)

Yao has been tasked to support some of the Deploy <> 
Development design patterns (similar to what Ryan and Yao tag-teamed on 
for Subscriptions). She works closely with Jason and Everett to identify
 basic functionality/patterns  for upcoming projects and will design 
those out. If you identify design components needed for your project 
early on, you can connect with Yao so she can help you get a head start 
on that.

## Optimization Team

The Optimization Team supports a lot of the data and 
analytics activities for your project. They’ll be more heavily involved 
at early stages of your project to help interpret the client’s current 
state analytics and some potential goals. This information will be 
crucial for orientation + discovery when you’re helping to create that 
narrative for the project vision.

## Deploy Teams

You will be joining one of the Deploy Teams. At the time of
 writing, there are 3 teams and soon to be 5 teams total. We expect that
 this number will continue to grow.

You will primarily spend your day-to-day working with the 
Myplaneteers within your Deploy team. As the teams and processes evolve,
 some teams will develop an expertise in a given phase of the overall 
product deployment. This means that between deploy teams there will be a
 need to interact to ensure healthy handoffs and context/knowledge 
transfers.
